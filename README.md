# Supplementary materials for global survival stacking paper

This repository contains code to reproduce the analyses in ["A framework for leveraging machine learning tools to estimate personalized survival curves"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03031) by Wolock, Gilbert, Simon, and Carone (2022+). All analyses were implemented using the `R` package `survML`, which is available [here](https://github.com/cwolock/survML).
